    <h1>Climate Change Impact: Rising Sea Levels Threaten Coastal Cities</h1>
    
    <p>New research reveals accelerating ice melt in Antarctica could raise global sea levels faster than previously predicted. Scientists warn that coastal communities need to prepare for significant changes in the coming decades.</p>
    
    <p>Recent studies conducted by leading climate researchers indicate that the rate of ice melt in Antarctica has tripled in the last decade. This acceleration could lead to a sea level rise of up to 3 feet by 2100 if current trends continue.</p>
    
    <p>Coastal cities worldwide are already implementing adaptation strategies, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Building sea walls and flood barriers</li>
        <li>Improving drainage systems</li>
        <li>Developing evacuation plans</li>
        <li>Updating building codes for flood resilience</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Scientists emphasize that immediate action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is crucial to preventing worst-case scenarios.</p>
